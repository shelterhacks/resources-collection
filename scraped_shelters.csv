"Y2Y Harvard Square - Seasonal Shelter - Cambridge, MA ","Boston, MA",,"1 Church St Cambridge, MA",(617) 864-0795,http://y2yharvardsquare.org/,"Y2Y is an emergency shelter for young adults. We accept anyone between the ages of 18-24. We also accept some 25 year-olds, as long as they were still 24 years of age at the beginning of our operational season (November 1st). Under no circumstances can we accept guests who are less than 18 years old.Y2Y is not a wet shelter or a dry shelter. It is a safe shelter. At the door each night, our youth worker on staff will assess if everyone is safe to be in the space (i.e. not a potential danger to themselves and others). Our youth worker will also assess whether everyone who enters the shelter will be a non-disruptive and constructive presence in the space that evening.Because of our youth-to-youth volunteer model, we don’t have the ability to accept guests who need close medical supervision or guests who may be disruptive in the space. We use behavioral, not biological, thresholds to determine safety.Getting A BedY2Y offers two kinds of stays, 30-night stays and 1-night stays. We only give away beds by lottery. Here is a printable version of information about Y2Y, services provided, and how to receive a bed.30 Night Stays At ShelterEnter the 30-night bed lottery by calling us in the morning at (617)864-0795 between 8:00 A.M and 8:45 A.M in the morning. A Y2Y staff member will ask for your name and date of birth, and then give you a lottery number.To check if you have won the 30-night lottery, call us back after 8:50 A.M. or come to the entrance of the shelter, where we will post winning lottery numbers daily.1 Night StaysEnter the 1-night bed lottery by calling us in the evening between 9:00 P.M. and 9:30 P.M. Then, call back after 9:35 P.M. to check if you have won a bed for that night. You must arrive at the shelter by 11:45 P.M.You may enter both the 30-night lottery and the 1-night lottery on the same day. For example, if you call us in the morning but do not receive a 30-night bed, you may call us that same evening to enter the 1-night lottery.More InformationOn a few days, beds will not be available at Y2Y if we have no space. If you call, a Y2Y staff member will tell you that beds are not available that day. We encourage you to call back the next day to re-enter the lottery, as beds will frequently open up.Do not enter the 30-night lottery more than once per day, or you may be disqualified. However, if you do not win the 30-night lottery, we encourage you to call back in the evening for a one-night stay, or call back the next day to re-enter the lottery.Case mangers, social workers, and other individuals may enter the lottery on behalf of someone else. If you are entering the lottery on behalf of someone else, make sure that person is aware you are doing so, and ready to accept a bed immediately. Make sure no one else is entering the lottery on behalf of that person, since double entries may lead to disqualification.You can contact the shelter through email: info@y2yharvardsquare.org. Volunteers Requests by Y2Y Harvard Square - Seasonal Shelter: As a volunteer with Y2Y, you will have the opportunity to both change lives and experience personal change. You will have the opportunity to learn from your fellow volunteers on shift, from staff members through reflections, and from our guests through countless meaningful conversations shared in the shelter. You’ll become part of our kind, supportive, and fun community with almost 200 of your peers. We hope that Y2Y can be a place for all of us — volunteers, staff, and guests — to rest, grow, and lead together, and we sincerely hope that you will join us! Do you have items to donate?

Women and men have access to a professional, caring staff and will receive treatment in a safe, sober, and therapeutic environment. The center will provide clinical and support services to individuals to help address the wide variety of issues arising from substance abuse and substance dependence, including: Individual and family counseling Case management to address vocational, financial, medical, mental health, educational, rehabilitative, and housing needs Referral to other services dependent on level of care needed (i.e. inpatient treatment, vocational training) Patient education related to sobriety, medical and mental health Patient education related to transmission of infectious diseases (i.e. TB, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STDs) Patient education related to smoking cessation Aftercare and transition planningSafe & Healthy ProgramOur year-round Safe & Healthy program members receive a nightly meal, bathroom and shower facilities, and breakfast before departing in the morning. Members also may speak with a case manager who may suggest further recovery programs, depending on the individual's needs. Nurses and a doctor are available thanks to a partnership with Boston Health Care for the Homeless.Emergency Overflow ShelterDuring the chilly winter months, our emergency shelter hosts people who don't have a place to sleep. Participants arrive in the evening, are screened for safety, and receive meals, shower facilities, and safe beds out of the cold. Guests leave in the morning, but may return the next evening if needed. This program generally runs between November or December through April, and is renewed on a yearly basis depending on the availability of state resources which anchor the program.Residential Recovery ProgramSubstance abuse is clearly one of the leading causes of homelessness and must be addressed in any prevention strategy. Unfortunately, recovery for individuals with limited financial means usually consists of a three to five day detoxification program provided by publicly funded insurance and a return to their typically unstable pre-detoxification living situation. This ""recovery"" is clearly inadequate, and many of these individuals soon revert to substance abuse and again put themselves at risk of becoming homeless.Each year, our recovery program provides hundreds of recovering alcoholics and addicts with a safe and therapeutic environment in which they can address their substance abuse issues and ultimately achieve a healthy, self-sufficient living situation. The program begins when a program member is referred by a licensed detoxification program. The referred program member is assigned to an individual case manager who conducts a careful and extensive evaluation to assess the program member's mental health and vocational, legal, cognitive behavioral, housing, medical, family, recovery, educational, and other needs. The case manager then develops an individualized care plan for the program member that is implemented through daily twelve step meetings. Over the course of the program, case managers and training sessions provide program members with substance abuse treatment, mental health services, anger management treatment, employment assistance, job training, housing assistance, and financial management assistance. In addition, program members participate in classes on living independently, repairing broken relationships, and improving social skills. The goal of these sessions is to build program member self-esteem and equip them with the tools and skills they need to achieve permanent self-sufficiency.All program services are provided without monetary commitment from program members. This provides an opportunity to save money, including provisions for outstanding legal obligations. Instead, program members are asked to participate in community service projects that contribute to the health and well-being of their treatment environment. This provides a structured environment for each of our program members, which is an essential ingredient to the success of any recovery program.When a program member is ready to embrace independent living with a community-based support network, graduates are provided with detailed discharge and aftercare planning. Case managers track and monitor the program member's progress after discharge. Formalized aftercare services are offered at Boston Rescue Mission as well as through informal relationships that have been formed through the treatment process. Graduates are welcome to utilize the Boston Rescue Mission for vocational training, employment assistance, housing assistance, or any other services on their journey to establish an independent and supportive housing environment.Sober Living ProgramThis fall, the Boston Rescue Mission launched an exciting new opportunity to support downtown Boston’s community of recovering alcoholics and addicts - the Sober Living program. Adult men with 30 days of sobriety can complete a short screening procedure to determine eligibility and enter the Kingston House as a member of a sober community.Like other sober communities, members abide by certain house rules to ensure safety and sobriety and pay a nominal weekly fee as a commitment to the program and to support the cost of their living space.But a few things distinguish the Mission’s Sober Living program from other sober communities:1. A centrally located and convenient downtown location is a huge plus for many program members, who can find and access places of employment and transportation options easily.2. Members' fees include all meals. Because the Mission serves so many people each day, it’s easy to include Sober Living members, and it saves a lot of money for members.3. Members have access to in-house group recovery meetings, case managers, spiritual development and many other resources available to residential recovery program members. Since many Sober Living members have recently graduated from a recovery program, these in-house resources are very attractive to potential members.The Mission sees the Sober Living program as a natural extension of our residential recovery program to fill a critical need in the recovery community of downtown Boston. We appreciate your prayers and support through the launch of this exciting program.Directions - Public TransportationDirections by the ""T"" (Boston's subway system):The Boston Rescue Mission is accessible by the Red, Orange and Green Lines.Take the Red Line to the Downtown Crossing stop.

"Kingston House - Boston Rescue Mission - Boston, MA ","Boston, MA",,"39 Kingston Street Boston, MA 02112",(617) 338-9000,https://www.brm.org/ : Follow us on Facebook,"Mission: * To offer resources that prevent and end homelessness * To support the recovery, health, faith, and independence of those who have a history of substance abuse, incarceration, and homelessness * To raise awareness about the root causes of these life risks * To serve everyone with respect, integrity, and grace * To continue to learn, grow, and excel in our services * To be good stewards of the resources entrusted to us by our supporters * To reflect the teachings of Jesus and the love of God in all we do Service: * Emergency Shelter * Food Pantries * Homeless Shelter * MealsOutpatient Counseling Center Kingston HouseThe Mission's Outpatient Counseling Center seeks to provide quality outpatient care to individuals struggling with substance abuse and substance dependence. Women and men have access to a professional, caring staff and will receive treatment in a safe, sober, and therapeutic environment. The center will provide clinical and support services to individuals to help address the wide variety of issues arising from substance abuse and substance dependence, including: Individual and family counseling Case management to address vocational, financial, medical, mental health, educational, rehabilitative, and housing needs Referral to other services dependent on level of care needed (i.e. inpatient treatment, vocational training) Patient education related to sobriety, medical and mental health Patient education related to transmission of infectious diseases (i.e. TB, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STDs) Patient education related to smoking cessation Aftercare and transition planningSafe & Healthy ProgramOur year-round Safe & Healthy program members receive a nightly meal, bathroom and shower facilities, and breakfast before departing in the morning. Members also may speak with a case manager who may suggest further recovery programs, depending on the individual's needs. Nurses and a doctor are available thanks to a partnership with Boston Health Care for the Homeless.Emergency Overflow ShelterDuring the chilly winter months, our emergency shelter hosts people who don't have a place to sleep. Participants arrive in the evening, are screened for safety, and receive meals, shower facilities, and safe beds out of the cold. Guests leave in the morning, but may return the next evening if needed. This program generally runs between November or December through April, and is renewed on a yearly basis depending on the availability of state resources which anchor the program.Residential Recovery ProgramSubstance abuse is clearly one of the leading causes of homelessness and must be addressed in any prevention strategy. Unfortunately, recovery for individuals with limited financial means usually consists of a three to five day detoxification program provided by publicly funded insurance and a return to their typically unstable pre-detoxification living situation. This ""recovery"" is clearly inadequate, and many of these individuals soon revert to substance abuse and again put themselves at risk of becoming homeless.Each year, our recovery program provides hundreds of recovering alcoholics and addicts with a safe and therapeutic environment in which they can address their substance abuse issues and ultimately achieve a healthy, self-sufficient living situation. The program begins when a program member is referred by a licensed detoxification program. The referred program member is assigned to an individual case manager who conducts a careful and extensive evaluation to assess the program member's mental health and vocational, legal, cognitive behavioral, housing, medical, family, recovery, educational, and other needs. The case manager then develops an individualized care plan for the program member that is implemented through daily twelve step meetings. Over the course of the program, case managers and training sessions provide program members with substance abuse treatment, mental health services, anger management treatment, employment assistance, job training, housing assistance, and financial management assistance. In addition, program members participate in classes on living independently, repairing broken relationships, and improving social skills. The goal of these sessions is to build program member self-esteem and equip them with the tools and skills they need to achieve permanent self-sufficiency.All program services are provided without monetary commitment from program members. This provides an opportunity to save money, including provisions for outstanding legal obligations. Instead, program members are asked to participate in community service projects that contribute to the health and well-being of their treatment environment. This provides a structured environment for each of our program members, which is an essential ingredient to the success of any recovery program.When a program member is ready to embrace independent living with a community-based support network, graduates are provided with detailed discharge and aftercare planning. Case managers track and monitor the program member's progress after discharge. Formalized aftercare services are offered at Boston Rescue Mission as well as through informal relationships that have been formed through the treatment process. Graduates are welcome to utilize the Boston Rescue Mission for vocational training, employment assistance, housing assistance, or any other services on their journey to establish an independent and supportive housing environment.Sober Living ProgramThis fall, the Boston Rescue Mission launched an exciting new opportunity to support downtown Boston’s community of recovering alcoholics and addicts - the Sober Living program. Adult men with 30 days of sobriety can complete a short screening procedure to determine eligibility and enter the Kingston House as a member of a sober community.Like other sober communities, members abide by certain house rules to ensure safety and sobriety and pay a nominal weekly fee as a commitment to the program and to support the cost of their living space.But a few things distinguish the Mission’s Sober Living program from other sober communities:1. A centrally located and convenient downtown location is a huge plus for many program members, who can find and access places of employment and transportation options easily.2. Members' fees include all meals. Because the Mission serves so many people each day, it’s easy to include Sober Living members, and it saves a lot of money for members.3. Members have access to in-house group recovery meetings, case managers, spiritual development and many other resources available to residential recovery program members. Since many Sober Living members have recently graduated from a recovery program, these in-house resources are very attractive to potential members.The Mission sees the Sober Living program as a natural extension of our residential recovery program to fill a critical need in the recovery community of downtown Boston. We appreciate your prayers and support through the launch of this exciting program.Directions - Public TransportationDirections by the ""T"" (Boston's subway system):The Boston Rescue Mission is accessible by the Red, Orange and Green Lines.Take the Red Line to the Downtown Crossing stop.

Other times the problems are long standing and difficult. Either way our dedicated team of case managers provide support, education, and guidance on the road to housing and self-sufficiency. Case Managers promote overall stability, emphasizing physical and behavioral health and nutrition. When needed, our case managers work with those in need of drug/alcohol rehabilitation through relationships with local rehabilitation programs, as well as proving transportation.Many clients elect to enroll in continued Case Management to maintain stability while in housing.
